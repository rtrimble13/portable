# Changelog

All notable changes to `portable` are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Two rules specific to this repository:

- **A schema change gets an entry here and a `schema_version` bump**, in the
  same commit as its migration (`CLAUDE.md`).
- **A change to a `PORT-GIPS-xxx` requirement gets an entry here either way**,
  and an ADR if it changes an implementation obligation
  (`docs/gips-standard.md` §13).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Repository scaffolding: `pyproject.toml` (scikit-build-core), pinned
  `requirements*.txt` plus `constraints.txt`, `Makefile`, pre-commit hooks, and
  `scripts/bootstrap.{sh,ps1}` for Linux and Windows.
- **Both project lint rules**, before there was any prose to police:
  - `no-float-in-money-paths` — flags float literals, `float` annotations and
    casts in `src/`, and `REAL`/`FLOAT`/`DOUBLE`/`NUMERIC` SQL column types.
    `NUMERIC` is included deliberately: SQLite's affinity silently stores it as
    `REAL`. A `# no-float: allow` marker requires a stated reason and has **no
    effect at all** inside a money-critical package.
  - `no-GIPS-compliance-language` (`PORT-GIPS-J05`) — allow-lists exactly three
    things: `docs/gips-standard.md`, the approved disclaimer wherever it
    appears, and a line carrying `gips-lint: allow`.
- `portable_core.disclaimer` — the single approved form of words, with the
  wrapping constraint that keeps it recognisable to the lint rule that protects
  it.
- C++ scaffolding: CMake + pybind11 + Catch2 matching `rtrimble13/po`'s
  conventions, a `portable_native` proof-of-concept module, and the
  native/Python fallback dispatch with differential tests.
- Stub CLIs for `pert`, `po`, and `risky` that print what they will do and exit
  non-zero. No function returns a plausible default.
- CI: lint/types/project rules, the suite across Linux and Windows × Python
  3.11/3.12, a pure-Python job proving `PORTABLE_BUILD_NATIVE=OFF` still works,
  and the C++ build with Catch2 on both platforms.
- Documentation: `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/domain-model.md`, and eleven
  ADRs covering every decision the bootstrap prompt left open.

### Changed

- `CLAUDE.md` invariant 11 carries `gips-lint: allow` markers on the three lines
  that name the prohibited phrases in order to forbid them. This is the case the
  marker exists for, and `CLAUDE.md` says so itself.

## [0.1.0] — unreleased

Initial release: `portable_core`, the `.port` format, and `pt`.
